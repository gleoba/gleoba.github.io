<code>Challenge: </code>Create an assistant chatbot to help users efficiently find answers within internal knowledge repositories.<br/>
<code>Solution: </code>I designed an intelligent assistant using Azure OpenAI that transforms how employees access company information. With RAG architecture, the solution provides contextually-aware semantic search, allowing the system to understand user intent and deliver precise information from across the knowledge ecosystem. Users simply ask questions in natural language and receive accurate responses grounded in verified internal documentation. This enterprise-ready implementation significantly improves knowledge accessibility without compromising data privacy, demonstrating how AI can enhance productivity while maintaining information security and accuracy.

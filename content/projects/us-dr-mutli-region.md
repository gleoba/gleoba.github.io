<code>Challenge: </code>Design a robust disaster recovery solution for mission-critical operational management and observability systems targeting both AWS and Azure environments.<br/>
<code>Solution: </code>As Lead Software Architect for ACMP, I developed a comprehensive multi-regional disaster recovery architecture that prioritized vendor-agnostic approaches through abstracted concepts and tooling. The architecture delivered enterprise-grade resilience through a carefully orchestrated system featuring both Active-Warm-Standby and Active-Active component configurations. Core capabilities included real-time data replication, incremental backup automation with synthetic full dumps, and transparent failover mechanisms with user-controlled checkpoints. The solution provided clear visibility into automation processes while meeting stringent RTOs and RPOs. Design considerations extended beyond immediate implementation to address long-term TCO, including provisions for regular disaster recovery testing protocols.

    content="I'm based in Netanya, where I balance my passion for technology with a rich personal life. As a proud parent of wonderful grown children, I value the perspective that comes from watching others grow and develop.<br/>I'm an avid consumer of knowledge through books, podcasts, and films that challenge my thinking and broaden my horizons.<br/>Yoga keeps me grounded, teaching me balance and mindfulness that surprisingly often applies to solving complex technical problems.<br/>When it comes to sports, I've pushed my limits through 12 full marathons. My athletic endeavors have expanded to include triathlons, combining my love for running with swimming and cycling. These endurance challenges mirror my professional approach: strategic planning, consistent effort, and the determination to go the distance.<br/>This multidimensional life reflects my belief that the best solutions, whether in technology or personal growth, come from diverse experiences and perspectives.<br/>For professional details, please explore my <a href='/experience'>Profile</a>, <a href='/cv'>CV</a>, or connect with me on LinkedIn."
